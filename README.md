Taken from http://humaan.com/getting-started-with-webpack-and-react-es6-style/

Modified webpack-dev-server config to be accessible by a machine other than the one running it.

Additionally, it is recommended that you globally install the following NPM packages:

* eslint
* babel-eslint
* eslint-plugin-react
